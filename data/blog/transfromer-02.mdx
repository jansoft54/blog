This new version, particularly the LLaMA 3.3 70B model, demonstrates remarkable performance that
either matches or surpasses the capabilities of OpenAI's closed-source GPT-4o across a wide range of
benchmarks. LLaMA 3 represents a significant leap in large language model development, building upon
Meta's ongoing commitment to open-source AI innovation. In this blog post, we will look at the
architectural advancements and optimizations that set LLaMA 3 apart from earlier models and the
original transformer framework.

# Prerequisites

Before diving into the model's code, we will first explore the most significant architectural innovation introduced in Llama 3.

## Rotary positional Encodings (RoPE)

Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) are an advanced method for encoding positional information in transformer models, designed to enhance their ability to process sequential data.
Unlike fixed or learned positional embeddings, RoPE introduces a rotational transformation in the query and key vectors of the self-attention mechanism.
This approach embeds positional relationships directly into the angular components of these vectors, allowing the model to generalize better across different sequence lengths and maintain relative positional information.

Given the vectors $$q_m$$ and $$k_n$$, which represent the embedded vectors of a word at positions
$$m$$ and $$n$$ in a sequence, the self-attention mechanism between these tokens at different
positions is defined by $$q_m^\top k_n$$ or $$q_m k_n^\top$$, depending on whether the configuration
is row-wise or column-wise.

To incorporate relative positional information, we aim to express the inner product of the query vector $$q_m$$ and the key vector $$k_n$$ as a function $$g$$. This function should depend solely on the word embeddings $$x_m$$ and $$x_n$$, as well as their relative position $$m - n$$.
In other words, the inner product should encode positional information solely in a relative manner:

$$\langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_n, n) \rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m - n).$$

The primary objective is to devise an encoding mechanism such that the functions $$f_q(x_m, m)$$ and $$f_k(x_n, n)$$ align with and satisfy this relationship.

This is illustrated in the exemplary [figure](#rope_rel) below. The later the word "dog" appears in the sentence, the more it is rotated. However, the most important observation is that the rotation angle between two word vectors (e.g., between "pig" and "dog") remains consistent if their relative distance stays the same, regardless of their absolute position or the length of the sentence. This is what the existence of such a function $$g$$ implies.

<figure style={{ width: '100%', margin: 'auto', paddingLeft: '0%' }}>

    alt="Description of the image"
    style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>
To derive RoPE, we will focus on the case where $$x_q$$ and $$x_k$$ are 2-dimensional. We define
their positionally encoded counterparts as:

$$
q_m = f_q(x_q, m), \\
k_n = f_k(x_k, n),
$$

where $$m$$ and $$n$$ denote their positions, such that:

$$
q_m^\top k_n = \langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_n, n) \rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m - n).
$$

Additionally, we define the initial conditions for $$m = n = 0$$ as:

$$
q = f_q(x_q, 0), \\
k = f_k(x_k, 0).
$$

To find solutions for $$f_q$$ and $$f_k$$, we note that our vectors $$x_q$$ and $$x_k$$ are 2-dimensional. This allows us to represent them as a complex number $$z_{(q,k)}$$ using Euler's formula:

$$
e^{i\phi} = \cos(\phi) + i\sin(\phi).
$$

Using this representation, we can define $$f_q$$, $$f_k$$, and $$g$$ as follows:

$$
f_q(x_q, m) = R_q(x_q, m)e^{i\Theta(x_q, m)} = q_m, \\
f_k(x_k, n) = R_k(x_k, n)e^{i\Theta(x_k, n)} = k_n, \\
g(x_q, x_k, m-n) = R_g(x_q, x_k, m-n)e^{i\Theta(x_q, x_k, m-n)}.
$$

Here, $$R$$ represents the magnitude (scaling factor) and $$\Theta$$ represents the phase (angle of rotation) for the respective functions. This complex representation elegantly encodes both magnitude and phase, enabling us to incorporate relative positional information.
As we want to satisfy $$\langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_n, n) \rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m - n).$$,
we can derive the following eqautions for the radial and phase functions $$R$$ and $$\Theta$$:

$$
R_q(x_q, m)R_k(x_k, n) = R_g(x_q, x_k, n - m) \\
\Theta_k(x_k, n) - \Theta_q(x_q, m) = \Theta_g(x_q, x_k, n - m)
$$

The derivation of the first one is indeed trival. The $$\Theta$$ equality can be derived as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_n, n) \rangle
&= (R_q(x_q, m)e^{i\Theta(x_q, m)})^{*}R_k(x_k, n)e^{i\Theta(x_k, n)} \\
&= R_q(x_q, m)e^{-i\Theta(x_q, m)}R_k(x_k, n)e^{i\Theta(x_k, n)} \\
&= R_q(x_q, m)R_k(x_k, n)e^{i {{(\Theta(x_k, n)-\Theta(x_q, m))}}} \\
&= R_g(x_q, x_k, m-n)e^{i{{\Theta(x_q, x_k, m-n)}}} \\
&= g(x_q, x_k, m-n).
\end{aligned}
$$

In this representation, our initial conditions can be defined as:

$$
q = \|q\|e^{i\theta_q} = R_q(x_q, 0)e^{i\Theta_q(x_q, 0)}, \\
k = \|k\|e^{i\theta_k} = R_k(x_k, 0)e^{i\Theta_k(x_k, 0)}.
$$

With the following relationships:

$$
\Theta_q(x_q, 0) = \theta_q, \\
\Theta_k(x_k, 0) = \theta_k,
$$

and

$$
R_q(x_q, 0) = \|q\|, \\
R_k(x_k, 0) = \|k\|.
$$

Now, setting $$m = n$$ and leveraging our knowledge about the initial conditions, we obtain:

$$
R_q(x_q, m)R_k(x_k, m) = R_g(x_q, x_k, 0) = R_q(x_q, 0)R_k(x_k, 0) = \|q\|\|k\|, \\
\Theta_k(x_k, m) - \Theta_q(x_q, m) = \Theta_g(x_q, x_k, 0) = \Theta_k(x_k, 0) - \Theta_q(x_q, 0) = \theta_k - \theta_q.
$$

From this, we can observe that a _possible_ straight forward solution for $$R_q$$, $$R_k$$, and $$R_g$$ can be derived as follows:

$$
R_q(x_q, m) = R_q(x_q, 0) = \|q\|, \\
R_k(x_k, n) = R_k(x_k, 0) = \|k\|, \\
R_g(x_q, x_k, n - m) = R_g(x_q, x_k, 0) = \|q\|\|k\|.
$$

From this, we can see that these solutions for $$R_q$$, $$R_k$$, and $$R_g$$ are, in fact, independent of any positional information.

Additionally, we observe that $$\Theta$$ in $$\Theta_q(x_q, m) - \Theta_k(x_k, m) = \theta_q - \theta_k$$ is independent of $$x_q$$ or $$x_k$$. Since $$\Theta_q(x_q, m) - \Theta_k(x_k, m) = \theta_q - \theta_k$$, there must exist some function $$\psi(m)$$ such that:

$$
\Theta_q(x_q, m) = \psi(m) + \theta_q, \\
\Theta_k(x_k, m) = \psi(m) + \theta_k.
$$

Now letâ€™s set $$n=m+1$$, which means we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Theta_k(x_k, n) - \Theta_q(x_q, m)
&= \psi(m+1) + \theta_k - \psi(m) - \theta_q \\
&= \psi(m+1) - \psi(m) + \theta_k - \theta_q \\
&= \Theta_g(x_q, x_k, 1) \\
&\iff \psi(m+1) - \psi(m) = \Theta_g(x_q, x_k, 1) + \theta_q - \theta_k.
\end{aligned}
$$

As $$\Theta_g(x_q, x_k, 1) + \theta_q - \theta_k$$ is constant, we can write $$\psi$$ as

$$
\psi(m) = m\theta + \gamma
$$

with $$\theta = \Theta_g(x_q, x_k, 1) + \theta_q - \theta_k \neq 0 $$ and $$\gamma \in \mathcal{R}$$.

This means when now have a way to write our encoding functions $$f_q$$and $$f_k$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_q(x_q, m) &= \|q\|e^{i(\theta_q + m\theta + \gamma)} =\|q\|e^{i\theta_q }e^{i(m\theta + \gamma)} = q e^{i(m\theta + \gamma)}, \\
f_k(x_k, n) &= \|k\|e^{i(\theta_k + n\theta + \gamma)} =\|k\|e^{i\theta_k }e^{i(m\theta + \gamma)} = k e^{i(n\theta + \gamma)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

As we dont make assumtions about $$f_q(x_q,0)$$ and $$f_k(x_k,0)$$ we choose

$$
q = f_q(x_q,0) = W_qx_q \\
k = f_k(x_k,0) = W_kx_k
$$

Therefore we can derive the following solution:

$$
f_q(x_q,m) = (W_qx_q) e^{im\theta} \\
f_k(x_k,n) = (W_kx_k) e^{in\theta}
$$

Instead of using Euler's formula with complex numbers, we can express rotations in the attention mechanism using rotation matrices. Let's define a rotation matrix $$R^d_{\Theta,m}$$
which rotates 2D vectors by $$m\theta$$:

$$
R^d_{\Theta,m} = \begin{pmatrix}
cos(m\theta) & -sin(m\theta)\\
sin(m\theta) & cos(m\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

We can now rewrite $$f_q$$ and $$f_k$$ as follows:

$$
f_q(x_q,m) = R^d_{\Theta,m} (W_qx_q) \\
f_k(x_k,n) = R^d_{\Theta,n} (W_kx_k)
$$

Using this matrix representation, the standard attention mechanism can be expressed as:

$$
q_m^Tk_n = (R^d_{\Theta,m} W_qx_m)^T(R^d_{\Theta,n} W_kx_n) = x_m^TW_q (R^d_{\Theta,m}R^d_{\Theta,n})W_kx_n =
 x_m^TW_q R^d_{\Theta,m-n}W_kx_n
$$

the last equality highlights a crucial point: the applied rotation depends solely on the distance between tokens ($$m - n$$) and not on the sentence length or absolute token positions

Currently, we have only considered 2D vectors for $$x_q$$ and $$x_k$$. To generalize this to $$x_{q,k} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$, we divide the $$d$$-dimensional vector into $$d/2$$ two-dimensional subspaces. Each subspace is rotated based on the position of the token in the sequence.

Now given a $$x_{m} \in \mathcal{R}^d$$, we formulate a $$R^d\_{\Theta,m}$$, with:

$$
R^d_{\Theta,m} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos m\theta_1 & -\sin m\theta_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
\sin m\theta_1 & \cos m\theta_1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \cos m\theta_2 & -\sin m\theta_2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \sin m\theta_2 & \cos m\theta_2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \cos m\theta_{d/2} & -\sin m\theta_{d/2} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \sin m\theta_{d/2} & \cos m\theta_{d/2}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

with pre-defined parameters:

$$
\Theta = \{\theta_i = 10000^{-2(i-1)/d}, \, i \in [1, 2, \dots, d/2]\}.
$$

This approach takes every pair of $$(W_{q,k}x_m)$$ and independently rotates it based on the position $$m$$ and the index $$i$$ of the pair in $$x_m$$ ($$\theta_i$$).

</figure>
The above figure illustrates this process. For each token embedding, we take successive 2D
subvectors and rotate them by a predefined angle $$\theta_i$$, where $$i$$ is the index of the
subvector within the token embedding, multiplied by $$m$$, the position of the token in the
sequence.

Note that the above formulation of $$\mathbf{R}^d_{\Theta,m}$$ is highly inefficient, as it constructs a mostly empty $$d \times d$$ matrix. Therefore, the paper introduces very simple elementwise vector operations, which are equivalent to multiplying $$W_{q,k}x_m$$with the very sparse $$\mathbf{R}^d_{\Theta,m} $$. It defines

$$
R^d_{\Theta,m}W_{q,k}x_m =
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
\vdots \\
x_{d-1} \\
x_d
\end{pmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(m\theta_1) \\
\cos(m\theta_1) \\
\cos(m\theta_2) \\
\cos(m\theta_2) \\
\vdots \\
\cos(m\theta_{d/2}) \\
\cos(m\theta_{d/2})
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
-x_2 \\
x_1 \\
-x_4 \\
x_3 \\
\vdots \\
-x_d \\
x_{d-1}
\end{pmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
\sin(m\theta_1) \\
\sin(m\theta_1) \\
\sin(m\theta_2) \\
\sin(m\theta_2) \\
\vdots \\
\sin(m\theta_{d/2}) \\
\sin(m\theta_{d/2})
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Now this is the operation that we will implement later in PyTorch.

## Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)

Grouped Query Attention (GQA) is an optimization technique in attention mechanisms, aimed at reducing the computational complexity of standard multi-head attention. Instead of computing a separate query for each head, GQA groups multiple heads together to share a single query representation.

<figure style={{ width: '100%', margin: 'auto', paddingLeft: '0%' }}>
  <img
    id="gqa"
    src="/static/images/blog/transformers02/gqa.webp"
    alt="Description of the image"
    style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>
The above figure illustrates this clearly. Each rectangle in the figure represents one attention
head. In standard attention, each head in the queries attends to the corresponding head in the keys.
However, in this approach, multiple query heads are grouped together to attend to a single key head.
The standart attention mechanism can be expressed as:

$$
Q = XW^Q, \quad K = XW^K, \quad V = XW^V,
$$

where:

- $$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{\text{model}}}$$ is the input sequence of token embeddings,
- $$W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{hs}}$$ are the weight matrices for the query, key, and value, respectively,
- $$Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{hs}}$$ are the computed query, key, and value matrices,
- $$n$$ is the sequence length, and $$d_\text{model}$$ is the embedding dimension.

Here, $$d_{hs} = \text{heads} \times d_h$$, where $$d_h$$ is the head dimension. In practice, $$d_\text{model} = \text{heads} \times d_h$$, as we later reshape the $$Q$$, $$K$$, and $$V$$ tensors into the shape:

$$
(\text{b}, \text{seq\_len},\text{heads}* d_h) \implies
(\text{b}, \text{seq\_len},\text{heads}, d_h) \implies
(\text{b}, \text{heads}, \text{seq\_len}, d_h).
$$

The fundamental difference in GQA lies in the shape of the weight matrices. In standard attention, the weight matrices are of size:

$$
d_{\text{model}} \times d_{hs},
$$

where $$d_{hs} = \text{heads} \times d_h$$.

In GQA, the weight matrices for $$K$$ and $$V$$ are of size:

$$
d_{\text{model}} \times (\text{heads}_{\text{kv}} * d_h),
$$

where $$\text{heads}_{\text{kv}}$$ refers to the number of key-value heads. For a group size of $$\text{group\_size} = 2$$, as shown in the figure, the number of key-value heads is reduced:

$$
\text{heads}_{\text{kv}} = \frac{\text{heads}}{\text{group\_size}} = 4.
$$

This will result in the shape $$(\text{b}, \text{seq\_len},\text{heads}_{\text{kv}}* d_h) $$ for our $$K,V$$. Such that we can reshape them into:

$$
(\text{b}, \text{seq\_len},\text{heads}_{\text{kv}}* d_h) \implies
(\text{b}, \text{seq\_len},\text{heads}_{\text{kv}}, d_h) \implies
(\text{b}, \text{heads}_{\text{kv}}, \text{seq\_len}, d_h).
$$

Now, since $$\text{heads}_{\text{kv}} \leq \text{heads}$$, we observe that by sharing attention heads between queries, we can drastically reduce the memory footprint.

# Preparing the Dataset

We will train out Llama model on the **TinyStories** datasets.
The TinyStories dataset is a dataset of short, narrative-style stories designed to be used for training natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly language models like Llama. These dataset consist of small, self-contained stories that capture a variety of writing styles, including simple plots, dialogues, and events, making them suitable for fine-tuning language models on tasks related to story generation. This is a small
example from the TinyStories dataset:

_Once upon a time, there was a little car named Beep. Beep loved to go fast and play in the sun. Beep was a healthy car because he always had good fuel. Good fuel made Beep happy and strong. One day, Beep was driving in the park when he saw a big tree. The tree had many leaves that were falling. Beep liked how the leaves fall and wanted to play with them. Beep drove under the tree and watched the leaves fall on him. He laughed and beeped his horn. Beep played with the falling leaves all day. When it was time to go home, Beep knew he needed more fuel. He went to the fuel place and got more healthy fuel. Now, Beep was ready to go fast and play again the next day. And Beep lived happily ever after_.

Now letâ€™s look our code that prepares this dataset for training:

```python
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset

torch.set_printoptions(profile="full")
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast
from model import Llama3, ModelArgs
from transformers import DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()],  # Logs to stdout
)
logger = logging.getLogger()

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

max_seq_len = 256
batch_size = 70
dataset = load_dataset("roneneldan/TinyStories", split="train").select(range(1000))
tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})


def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], max_length=max_seq_len, truncation=True)


dataset = dataset.filter(
    lambda example: example["text"] is not None and example["text"].strip() != ""
)

tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(
    tokenize_function, batched=True, remove_columns=["text"]
)

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

dataloader = DataLoader(
    tokenized_dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=True,
    collate_fn=lambda feature: Llama3.gen_labels(feature, tokenizer, data_collator),
)
```

This loads the TinyStories dataset and prepares it for training a language model. It tokenizes the text using **GPT2TokenizerFast**, ensuring that the sequences are of a fixed length (**max_seq_len**). The dataset is filtered to remove empty or invalid texts. A DataLoader is created using a custom collate function (`Llama3.gen_labels`) to generate labels for training, while efficiently handling batch processing with **DataCollatorForLanguageModeling**, which pads sequences and generates attention masks.

```python
class Llama3
  (...)
  @staticmethod
  def __build_masks(seq_len, attention_mask, device, position=0, training=False):
      causal = torch.tril(torch.ones(seq_len, seq_len, dtype=torch.bool)).unsqueeze(0)
      (...)
      if attention_mask == None:
          return causal
      attention_mask = attention_mask.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, seq_len, 1).int()

      return (causal & attention_mask).int()

  @staticmethod
  def gen_labels(labels, tokenizer, data_collator, ignore_index=-100):
      batch = data_collator(labels)
      labels = batch["labels"]
      attention_mask = batch["attention_mask"]
      for i in range(labels.shape[0]):
          l = torch.roll(labels[i], -1)
          target_indices = (l == ignore_index).nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0]
          if len(target_indices) == 0:
              l[-1] = tokenizer.eos_token_id
          else:
              seq_len = len(l) - len(target_indices)
              l[-1] = ignore_index
              l[seq_len - 1] = tokenizer.eos_token_id

          labels[i] = l

      batch["labels"] = labels
      batch["attention_mask"] = Llama3.__build_masks(
          labels.shape[1], attention_mask, device, training=True
      )
  (...)
```

The `gen_labels` function is designed to prepare the labels for training by shifting them one token to the left and appending an **EOS** (End of Sequence) token at the end. At the start of the function, the labels are just a copy of the input. The challenge is to place the **EOS** token at the correct position, which requires determining the length of the unpadded sequence. If padding is present, the function places the **EOS** token at the end of the actual data, not on top of padding tokens. If no padding exists, the **EOS** token is placed at the very end of the sequence.

Once the labels are shifted and the **EOS** token is placed correctly, the function must handle the attention masks. Since **DataCollatorForLanguageModeling** provides an array of attention values for a single sequence, the function needs to convert this into a matrix that can be used for causal language modeling. This involves combining the attention mask with a causal mask, which is a lower triangular matrix, ensuring that the model only attends to previous tokens in the sequence and not to any future tokens.

# Llama3 - Model Architecture

## Llama3 Architecture Overview

Now that we have everything in place, let's look at how the **Llama3** architecture is structured. Below is an overview of its design:

<figure style={{ width: '100%', margin: 'auto', paddingLeft: '15%' }}>
  <img
    id="llama3"
    src="/static/images/blog/transformers02/llama3-arch.png"
    alt="Description of the image"
    style={{ width: '70%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

As we can see, **Llama3** is conceptually very similar to the vanilla transformer architecture.
Most importantly, the Llama3 and other GPT-style models only consist of a decoder-only transformer. This means that we won't use the encoder and the cross-attention, which we covered in the previous blog post.
Another notable change that stands out is the use of **RMSNorm** instead of **LayerNorm** for normalization.

$$
\text{RMSNorm}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot \gamma
$$

$$
\text{LayerNorm}(x) = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon} \cdot \gamma + \beta
$$

While **LayerNorm** normalizes the input by using the mean and standard deviation of the tensor, **RMSNorm** uses the root mean square of the elements, making it simpler and computationally more efficient. Both methods have learnable **scaling** $$\gamma$$ and **bias** $$\beta$$ parameters, but **RMSNorm** avoids the need for computing the mean and standard deviation, which can be more efficient in practice.

Additionally, we observe that the _positional encoding_ (RoPE) is applied directly to the **queries** and **keys** in the attention layer, rather than at the embedding level. The **values**, however, are not position encoded.

After that the outputs of the attention layer are again feed into a FFN. This time however we use the so called **SwiGLU** activation function.
The **SwiGLU** (Swish-Gated Linear Unit) activation function is a variation of the standard activation functions like **ReLU** and **GELU**. It is designed to combine the benefits of the **Swish** activation function and the **Gated Linear Unit** (GLU). SwiGLU introduces a gating mechanism using a linear function combined with the **Swish** activation, which helps improve model performance, particularly in transformer-based architectures.

The **SwiGLU** activation function is mathematically defined as:

$$
\text{SwiGLU}(x) = \text{Swish}(x) \cdot   h(X)
$$

Where:

- **$$Swish(x)$$** is the **Swish** activation function defined as:

  $$
  \text{Swish}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x)
  $$

  with $$\sigma(x)$$ being the **sigmoid function**:

  $$
  \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
  $$

- **$$h(X)$$** is the Gated Linear Unit with:
  $$ h(X)=(XW+b) \otimes \sigma(XV+c) \quad b,c \in \mathbb{R} $$
  with $$\otimes$$ being the element-wise product

Now that we have an overview of the **Llama3** architecture, let's quickly discuss the implementation of the **rotary positional encodings** in our model. As mentioned earlier, the direct formulation of a large, mostly empty
$$R^d_{\Theta,m} $$ matrix for positional encodings is inefficient and wasteful in terms of memory and computation.
Therefore, we pursue a different approach to implement positional encodings.

Below we have the `RoPE`-class, which implents the positional encoding.

```python
class RoPE:
    @staticmethod
    def compute_freq(head_dim: int, seq_len: int, base: int = 10000):
        exp = -2 * torch.arange(0, head_dim, 2).float() / head_dim
        thetas = torch.pow(base, exp)
        m = torch.arange(0, seq_len).float()
        freq = torch.outer(m, thetas).float()
        freq_comp = torch.polar(torch.ones_like(freq), freq)
        return freq_comp

    @staticmethod
    def apply_rotary_embedding(x: torch.Tensor, freq_cis):
        # batch,seq_len,heads,d_k
        x_comp = torch.view_as_complex(x.float().reshape(*(x.shape[:-1]), -1, 2))
        freq_com = freq_cis.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(2)

        x_out = torch.view_as_real(x_comp * freq_com).reshape(*x.shape)
        return x_out.float()
```

The **`compute_freq`** function precomputes the $$ m\theta_i $$ for $$m \leq \text{max\_len} $$ and $$i \leq \text{d\_model} $$.

While the first two lines implement the following equation:

$$
\Theta = \{\theta_i = 10000^{-2(i-1)/d}, \, i \in [1, 2, \dots, d/2]\},
$$

the third line implements the outer product between the array of positions and the $$\theta_i $$.

Lastly, we use `torch.polar`, which converts the number into a complex number using the matrix entries as angular components. Mathematically, this whole process can be expressed as:

$$
\psi = M\Theta^T = \begin{bmatrix}
m_1 \theta_1 & m_1  \theta_2 & \dots & m_1 \theta_{d/2} \\
m_2 \theta_1 & m_2 \theta_2 & \dots & m_2 \theta_{d/2} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
 m_{\text{max}} \theta_1 & m_{\text{max}} \theta_2 & \dots & m_{\text{max}}  \theta_{d/2}
\end{bmatrix}
\text{, with }
M = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
\text{max}
\end{bmatrix}

\Theta = \begin{bmatrix}
\theta_0 \\
\vdots \\
\theta_{d/2} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

After the `torch.polar` operation, which converts the matrix entries into their polar representation, it looks like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
polar(\psi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
cos(m_1 \theta_1) + i sin(m_1 \theta_1) & cos(m_1  \theta_2) + i sin(m_1  \theta_2) & \dots & cos(m_1 \theta_{d/2}) +  i sin(m_1 \theta_{d/2})\\
cos(m_2 \theta_1) + i sin(m_2 \theta_1) & cos(m_2  \theta_2) + i sin(m_2  \theta_2) & \dots & cos(m_2 \theta_{d/2}) +  i sin(m_2 \theta_{d/2})\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
cos(m_{\text{max}} \theta_1) + i sin(m_{\text{max}} \theta_1) & cos(m_{\text{max}} \theta_2) + i sin(m_{\text{max}} \theta_2) & \dots & cos(m_{\text{max}} \theta_{d/2}) + i sin(m_{\text{max}} \theta_{d/2})
\end{bmatrix}


\end{aligned}
$$

As we can see the radial components are $$1$$.

We will now shift our focus on the `apply_rotary_embedding` function, which given
queries $$Q$$ and keys $$K$$, will encode them based on their position in the sentence.

letâ€™s demonstrate this problems bei focusing on $$polar(\psi)_j$$, which contains the angular
components for position $$j$$. Let $$x \in \{q,k\} \sub \mathbb{R}^{1 \times \text{d\_model}}$$ be the
queries ($$Q$$) and keys($$K$$). We will transfrom them in the following way:

$$
x =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
\vdots \\
x_{d-1} \\
x_d
\end{bmatrix}
\xrightarrow{\text{reshape}}
\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & x_2 \end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix} x_3 & x_4 \end{bmatrix} \\
\vdots \\
\begin{bmatrix} x_{d-1} & x_d \end{bmatrix} \\

\end{bmatrix}
\xrightarrow{\text{convert into complex}}

\begin{bmatrix}
 x_1 + ix_2 \\
 x_3 + ix_4 \\
\vdots \\
 x_{d-1} + ix_d \\

\end{bmatrix} = \hat{x}
$$

Now we take this vector of complex entries and multiply it element-wise with $$polar(\psi)_j$$:

$$
\begin{aligned}

\hat{x} \otimes polar(\psi)_j

&=

\begin{bmatrix}
 x_1 + ix_2 \\
 x_3 + ix_4 \\
\vdots \\
 x_{d-1} + ix_d \\
\end{bmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{bmatrix}
cos(j \theta_1) + i sin(j \theta_1) \\
cos(j  \theta_2) + i sin(j  \theta_2) \\
\vdots \\
cos(j \theta_{d/2}) +  i sin(j \theta_{d/2})\\
\end{bmatrix}\\

&=

\begin{bmatrix}
(x_1 + ix_2)(cos(j \theta_1) + i sin(j \theta_1)) \\
( x_3 + ix_4 )(cos(j  \theta_2) + i sin(j  \theta_2)) \\
\vdots \\
(x_{d-1} + ix_d)(cos(j \theta_{d/2}) +  i sin(j \theta_{d/2}))\\
\end{bmatrix} \\

&=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_2 \sin(j \theta_1) + i\left(x_1 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_2 \cos(j \theta_1)\right) \\
x_3 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_4 \sin(j \theta_1) + i\left(x_3 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_4 \cos(j \theta_1)\right) \\
\vdots \\
x_{d-1} \cos(j \theta_1) - x_d \sin(j \theta_1) + i\left(x_{d-1} \sin(j \theta_1) + x_d \cos(j \theta_1)\right) \\
\end{bmatrix}\\

\end{aligned}


$$

We can now view this result again as a real matrix and reshape it into its original dimension:

$$
\begin{aligned}

&\xrightarrow{\text{into real}}

\begin{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_2 \sin(j \theta_1) \quad  x_1 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_2 \cos(j \theta_1)\end{bmatrix} \\
\begin{bmatrix}x_3 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_4 \sin(j \theta_1) \quad x_3 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_4 \cos(j \theta_1)\end{bmatrix} \\
\vdots \\
\begin{bmatrix}x_{d-1} \cos(j \theta_1) - x_d \sin(j \theta_1) \quad x_{d-1} \sin(j \theta_1) + x_d \cos(j \theta_1) \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{bmatrix}\\


&\xrightarrow{\text{reshape}}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_2 \sin(j \theta_1) \\
x_1 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_2 \cos(j \theta_1) \\
x_3 \cos(j \theta_1) - x_4 \sin(j \theta_1) \\
x_3 \sin(j \theta_1) + x_4 \cos(j \theta_1) \\
\vdots \\
x_{d-1} \cos(j \theta_1) - x_d \sin(j \theta_1) \\
x_{d-1} \sin(j \theta_1) + x_d \cos(j \theta_1)  \\
\end{bmatrix}\\

&=
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
\vdots \\
x_{d-1} \\
x_d
\end{pmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(j\theta_1) \\
\cos(j\theta_1) \\
\cos(j\theta_2) \\
\cos(j\theta_2) \\
\vdots \\
\cos(j\theta_{d/2}) \\
\cos(j\theta_{d/2})
\end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix}
-x_2 \\
x_1 \\
-x_4 \\
x_3 \\
\vdots \\
-x_d \\
x_{d-1}
\end{pmatrix}
\otimes
\begin{pmatrix}
\sin(j\theta_1) \\
\sin(j\theta_1) \\
\sin(j\theta_2) \\
\sin(j\theta_2) \\
\vdots \\
\sin(j\theta_{d/2}) \\
\sin(j\theta_{d/2})
\end{pmatrix}\\
&= R^d_{\Theta,j}x


\end{aligned}


$$

As we can see, we arrived at our end result of $$R^d_{\Theta,j}x$$, with the operations performed in our PyTorch code in the function `apply_rotation`.

Now that we have covered the most important details that distinguish the Llama3 architecture from a vanilla decoder-only transformer, we can actually take a look at the code of the Llama class.

```

As this is rather much to comprehend, we will start with the **forward** method of the Llama class. It is easy to see that this just calls `__run_model`, which precomputes the frequency components for the position encoding, based on the position of the current token. This is a result of the **KV-Cache**, which we will cover in a bit. The determined $$ m_j \theta_i $$ are then passed to the decoder layers, together with the token embeddings and masks.

The **DecoderLayer** may be of more interest:

```python
class DecoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model=256, heads=4, group_size=2, max_seq_len=256):
        super(DecoderLayer, self).__init__()
        self.norm1 = nn.RMSNorm(d_model, eps=1e-6)
        self.norm2 = nn.RMSNorm(d_model, eps=1e-6)
        self.ffn = FFN(d_model=d_model)
        self.attention = MultiHeadGQAttention(
            heads=heads, d_model=d_model, group_size=group_size, max_seq_len=max_seq_len
        )

    def forward(self, x, tgt_causal_mask, pos, freqs_cis):
        x_norm = self.norm1(x)
        x = x + self.attention(
            x_norm, x_norm, x_norm, tgt_causal_mask, freqs_cis, position=pos
        )
        return x + self.ffn(self.norm2(x))
```

As we can see from our architecture overview from before, we first do an **RMSNorm** before we feed the output into the
**MultiHeadGQAttention** layer. Applying the skip connection and the **FFN** is pretty self explanotroy.
So the most interesting Layer is the **MultiHeadGQAttention**. So letâ€™s look at that:

```python
class MultiHeadGQAttention(nn.Module):
    flash = False

    def __init__(self, heads=4, d_model=256, group_size=2, max_seq_len=256):
        super(MultiHeadGQAttention, self).__init__()
        self.heads = heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.group_size = group_size

        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=False)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model // group_size, bias=False)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model // group_size, bias=False)
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model, bias=False)

    def forward(
        self,
        q,
        k,
        v,
        mask,
        freq_cis,
        position=-1,
    ):
        d_k = self.d_model // self.heads
        bs, seq_len = q.shape[:2]
        q, k, v = self.W_q(q), self.W_k(k), self.W_v(v)

        q = q.view(
            q.shape[0], q.shape[1], self.heads, -1
        )  # (batch,seq_len,heads,d_k) or (batch,1,heads,d_k)
        k = k.view(
            k.shape[0], k.shape[1], self.heads // self.group_size, -1
        )  # (batch,seq_len,heads,d_k) or (batch,1,heads,d_k)
        v = v.view(
            v.shape[0], v.shape[1], self.heads // self.group_size, -1
        )  # (batch,seq_len,heads,d_k) or (batch,1,heads,d_k)
        q = RoPE.apply_rotary_embedding(q, freq_cis)
        k = RoPE.apply_rotary_embedding(k, freq_cis)
        if not self.training:
            k, v = self.kv_cache.update(k, v, position)


        q, k, v = (x.transpose(1, 2) for x in (q, k, v))

        if MultiHeadGQAttention.flash:
            q, k, v = (x.contiguous() for x in (q, k, v))
            output = (
                F.scaled_dot_product_attention(
                    q, k, v, attn_mask=(mask == 1).unsqueeze(1)
                )
                .transpose(1, 2)
                .reshape(bs, seq_len, -1)
            )
        else:
            scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
            if mask is not None:
                mask = mask.unsqueeze(1)
                scores = torch.masked_fill(scores, mask == 0, float("-inf"))
                attention = nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
                output = (
                    torch.matmul(attention, v)
                    .transpose(1, 2)
                    .contiguous()
                    .view(bs, seq_len, -1)
                )

        output = self.W_o(output)
        return output
```

As we can see, this is standard functionality, with most parts being identical to the standard attention layer used in a decoder-only Transformer. However, the first difference arises in the weight matrices for $$ Q $$, $$ K $$, and $$ V $$. Specifically, we choose $$ K $$ and $$ V $$ to have dimensions $$\frac{\text{d\_model}}{\text{group\_size}} $$, where $$\frac{\text{d\_model}}{\text{group\_size}} = \text{heads}_{kv} $$.

In the $$\texttt{forward}$$ method, we use a standard reshaping mechanism to ensure that the resulting tensors for $$ Q $$, $$ K $$, and $$ V $$ have the shape $$\text{seq\_len} \times d\_{\text{head}} $$.

Next, we apply positional encoding to the queries and keys using the previously defined $$\texttt{apply\_rotary\_embedding}$$ function. As mentioned earlier, the $$\texttt{freq\_cis}$$ contain the terms $$ m_j\theta_i$$, where $$m_j$$ represents the positions of the tokens fed into the model. This step is crucial, especially during **inference**, as the entire sequence of tokens is not fed into the model repeatedly. We will delve into this aspect in more detail later.

Following this, we perform the now well-known attention operation between the encoded $$\textbf{queries}$$, $$\textbf{keys}$$, and the plain $$\textbf{values}$$. Additionally, there is an optional function called $$\texttt{scaled\_dot\_product\_attention}$$. This function provides a hardware- and memory-efficient implementation of the attention operation, commonly referred to as **flash attention**.

We will not go into much detail about flash attention in this post, but we may cover it in another post. For now, it suffices to say that this function implements attention more efficiently in terms of both hardware and memory usage.

Now this already completes the model code of Llama! We will use the following training code, along with the data preparation code from above, to make our tiny model tell us some stories!

```python

warmup = 100
lr = 1e-4
min_lr = 7e-5

args = ModelArgs(
    vocab_size=len(tokenizer),
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    d_model=256,
    heads=16,
    group_size=2,
    num_layers=32,
    max_seq_len=max_seq_len,
    use_flash=True,
)


epochs = 2

model = Llama3(args).to(device)
# model.load_state_dict(torch.load('tiny_stories_2.pth'))
model = torch.compile(model)
model.train()
optim = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(0.9, 0.999), weight_decay=0)
# lr_scheduler = InverseSquareRootLR(optim, warmup, lr, min_lr=min_lr)
logger.info(
    f"Param. count: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)}"
)
scaler = torch.GradScaler()

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):

        inputs = batch["input_ids"].to(device)
        labels = batch["labels"].to(device)
        attention_mask = batch["attention_mask"].to(device)

        optim.zero_grad()

        with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
            loss = model(inputs, attention_mask, labels)

        scaler.scale(loss).backward()

        scaler.unscale_(optim)
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

        scaler.step(optim)
        scaler.update()
        # lr_scheduler.step()

        logger.info(
            f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Step [{i+1}/{len(dataloader)}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}"
        )
        if (i + 1) % 1000 == 0:
            torch.save(model._orig_mod.state_dict(), "tiny_stories_50M.pth")
```

As you can see, there is nothing special about this code. We set up our optimizer, compile our Llama3 model, and feed the inputs and labels, such as the attention mask, into the model. Additionally, we use the $$\texttt{torch.amp} $$ package, which provides methods for implementing mixed-precision training.

Now that we have set up our training code, trained, and subsequently saved our model to $$\texttt{tiny\_stories\_50M.pth}$$, we can actually use this model to sample some stories from it. So let's do that!

# Optimizing Inference - The KV-Cache

One of the most important optimizations that Llama has introduced in their architecture is the so-called
**key-value cache**. The purpose of this becomes clear if we look at the figure below:

<figure style={{ width: '100%', margin: 'auto', paddingLeft: '10%' }}>
  <img
    id="rope"
    src="/static/images/blog/transformers02/kv_cache.gif"
    alt="Description of the image"
    style={{ width: '80%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

As you know, during inference we sample the next token and append it to the sequence before we
feed this new sequence into the transformer to predict the next token. But as you can see in the figure,
to predict **token 5**, we only need **query token 4** to multiply with the **keys**. This means to predict
**token 5**, we only need the last row of the attention matrix. Thus, instead of feeding in the entire
sequence of tokens of length $$n$$ to predict $$n+1$$, we just feed in the $$n$$-th token. For the
attention and subsequent multiplication with $$V$$, however, we still need the previous tokens.
This is exactly where the **key-value cache (kv-cache)** comes in.

<figure style={{ width: '100%', margin: 'auto', paddingLeft: '10%' }}>
  <img
    id="rope"
    src="/static/images/blog/transformers02/kv_cache02.png"
    alt="Description of the kv-cache mechanism"
    style={{ width: '80%', height: 'auto' }}
  />
</figure>

For every token we see, we save it in the **kv-cache** for later usage in the multiplications.
By doing this, we can save a significant amount of attention multiplications, as we only need to compute
the last row of the attention matrix! Nice!

Now lets look at the code for the KV-Cache:

```python
class KV_Cache(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, batch_size, seq_length, n_kv_heads, head_dim):
        super(KV_Cache, self).__init__()
        device = "cuda"
        cache_shape = (batch_size, seq_length, n_kv_heads, head_dim)
        self.cache_k = torch.zeros(cache_shape, device=device)
        self.cache_v = torch.zeros(cache_shape, device=device)

    def update(self, xk, xv, pos):
        bx, seq_len = xk.shape[:2]
        self.cache_k[:bx, pos : pos + seq_len] = xk
        self.cache_v[:bx, pos : pos + seq_len] = xv
        return self.cache_k[:bx, : pos + seq_len], self.cache_v[:bx, : pos + seq_len]

```

Here we reserve as much space as we could possibly need by constructing a zero tensor of shape
`(batch_size, max_seq_length, n_kv_heads, head_dim)`. Then, during the update, we pass in the current token
position and save the keys and values into the cache before returning all the cached values up to the current
point in time.

Here is how we will use it in the $$\texttt{MultiHeadGQAttention}$$ class:

```python
class MultiHeadGQAttention(nn.Module):
    flash = False
    def __init__(self, heads=4, d_model=256, group_size=2, max_seq_len=256):
        super(MultiHeadGQAttention, self).__init__()
        (...)
        self.kv_cache = KV_Cache(
            batch_size=4,
            seq_length=max_seq_len,
            n_kv_heads=self.heads // self.group_size,
            head_dim=d_model // heads,
        )

    def __repeat_kv(self, x):
        bs, slen, n_kv_heads, head_dim = x.shape
        return (
            x[:, :, :, None, :]
            .expand(bs, slen, n_kv_heads, self.group_size, head_dim)
            .reshape(bs, slen, n_kv_heads * self.group_size, head_dim)
        )
    def forward(
        self,
        q,
        k,
        v,
        mask,
        freq_cis,
        position=-1,
    ):
        (...)
        q = RoPE.apply_rotary_embedding(q, freq_cis)
        k = RoPE.apply_rotary_embedding(k, freq_cis)
        if not self.training:
            k, v = self.kv_cache.update(k, v, position)

        k = self.__repeat_kv(k)
        v = self.__repeat_kv(v)
        (...)
```

As you can see, we will store the **keys** and **values** in the cache _after_ we positional encoded them.
Now lets look at the $$\texttt{generate\_kv}$$ function, that actually handles sampling from the model,
utilizing the **kv-cache**:

```python
 def generate_kv(self, prompt, tokenizer, temp=1.0, top_p=None):
        device = "cuda"
        tokenized = tokenizer(prompt, max_length=self.max_seq_len, truncation=True)
        tokens = torch.tensor(tokenized["input_ids"]).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
        sampled_token = None
        sampled_tokens = tokens.squeeze(0).tolist()

        token_len = tokens.shape[1]

        mask = (
            torch.tril(torch.ones(token_len, token_len, dtype=torch.bool))
            .unsqueeze(0)
            .to(device)
        )
        i = 0
        for block in self.layers:
            block.attention.cache = KV_Cache(
                batch_size=1,
                seq_length=self.max_seq_len,
                n_kv_heads=self.heads // self.group_size,
                head_dim=self.d_model // self.heads,
            )
        while i < self.max_seq_len:

            logits = self.__run_model(tokens, mask, position=i)[:, -1, :] / temp
            probabilities = F.softmax(logits.float(), dim=-1).squeeze()
            if top_p is not None:
                sorted_probs, sorted_indices = torch.sort(
                    probabilities, descending=True
                )
                cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(sorted_probs, dim=-1)
                cutoff_index = torch.searchsorted(cumulative_probs, top_p, right=True)

                sorted_probs[cutoff_index + 1 :] = 0
                sorted_probs = sorted_probs / sorted_probs.sum()
                probabilities = torch.zeros_like(probabilities).scatter(
                    0, sorted_indices, sorted_probs
                )

                sampled_token = torch.multinomial(probabilities, num_samples=1)
            else:
                sampled_token = torch.multinomial(probabilities, num_samples=1)

            tokens = sampled_token.unsqueeze(0)
            if sampled_token.item() != tokenizer.eos_token_id:
                sampled_tokens.append(sampled_token.item())
            else:
                break
            i = len(sampled_tokens)
            mask = None

        return tokenizer.decode(sampled_tokens)
```

Now this function takes in a prompt like: `Once a little green car`. We then tokenize this sequence and create a causal mask. Next, we initialize the KV-Cache for each attention layer. The generation process then begins and ends either if
we exceed the `max_length` or if the special EOS token appears.

For sampling, we have two distinct strategies. The first one is **temperature sampling**, and the second is **top-p** sampling. Using temperature sampling, we divide the logits by the temperature variable. If the temperature is below 1, this sharpens the probability distribution after applying the softmax. A temperature greater than 1 has the opposite effect, leading to a more spread-out distribution and making previously less likely tokens more likely.
**Top-p sampling** will only consider the most likely tokens whose cumulative probability sum is less than or equal to $$p$$. Typical values for $$p$$ are $$0.8$$ or $$0.9$$.

Now using this code we can sample from the model like this:

```python
import torch
from model import Llama3, ModelArgs
from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style, init
init()

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token": "[PAD]"})
max_seq_len = 256

args = ModelArgs(
    vocab_size=len(tokenizer),
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    d_model=256,
    heads=4,
    group_size=2,
    num_layers=32,
    max_seq_len=max_seq_len,
    use_flash=True,
)
model = Llama3.from_pretrained("tiny_stories_50M.pth", args).to(device)
model.eval()

res = model.generate_kv("There once a little green car called Beep", tokenizer=tokenizer, top_p=0.65)

print(Fore.GREEN + res)
```

Running this will print:

_**There once a little green car called Beep**. Beep loved to drive around the town, but one day it got lost. Beep drove around looking for its way back, but it couldn't find its way back. Beep was so sad and started to cry.
Suddenly, Beep saw a big green truck. The truck said, "Don't worry Beep. I will help you find your way home." Beep was so happy and the truck said, "Let's go! I know the way!"
So Beep and the truck drove together, until they reached the other side of the town. When they arrived, Beep said, "Thank you for helping me. You're a good friend." The truck said, "You're welcome. It was nice to help."
Wep drove back home, feeling happy and relieved. It knew that the green truck was right. Beep and the truck were friends forever._

As you can see, this is already a pretty good story! Our model currently has about 50 million parameters and was trained on the TinyStories dataset for just one epoch. Due to the limitations of my GPU, which has only 8GB of VRAM, I had to use a smaller batch size. While this increases training times, I am planning to upgrade my hardware in the near future!

The complete code will be updated and made available on my GitHub page. This concludes my post about LLaMA3, and I hope you found it an enjoyable and informative read. If you spot any mistakes or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me!
